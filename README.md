# Ichiran

Ichiran is a collection of tools for working with text in Japanese language. It contains experimental segmenting and romanization algorithms and uses open source [JMdictDB](http://edrdg.org/~smg/) dictionary database to display meanings of words.

The web interface is under development right now.

## Notes

Currently incompatible with latest Postmodern due to [this issue](https://github.com/marijnh/Postmodern/issues/70). Please use ichiran branch of [my fork of Postmodern](https://github.com/tshatrov/Postmodern/tree/ichiran) until this is fixed. 

## Documentation

There is no documentation yet. Any API is considered unstable at this point.
